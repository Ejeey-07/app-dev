## Favorite series/movie

**Title:** *Stranger Things*  
**Why I like it:** I enjoy the mix of 1980s nostalgia, supernatural mystery, and strong character friendships. The pacing keeps chapters (episodes) moving, and the soundtrack adds a lot to the atmosphere.  
**Favorite character:** Steve Harrington — I like his character development from being a douchebag to one of the best big brother figures to the group.
